1. Description.  Task-Off helps keep track of a set of tasks and tasks' status (complete/incomplete).

Ideas for app:

2. Problem domain.  Family (or any group) sharing chores and tasks in a houshold (or some event, trip, etc...).  App shows current tasks, group members, who the tasks are assigned to, and if tasks are completed or not.  Users get to create a profile and later choose tasks and report when completed. Groups, users and tasks are kept in a database.
 
 3. Screens and flow

3.MVP
Admins are able to create a group and invite members.
Tasks are rendered in a list.
Users can sign up(?).
Mobile first.


4.Stretch goals: 
  Users choosing avatars.  
  Showing percentages of total work done by each user on the tasks page.  
  Keeping track of the tasks done in a user profile view.  
  Adding cordova wrapper.
